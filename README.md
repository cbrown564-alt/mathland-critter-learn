# Lovable: Interactive Math Learning Platform

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive, web-based math learning platform designed to make foundational algebra concepts engaging and accessible for students. The platform features a modular lesson structure, playful character guides, and a variety of interactive activities to support different learning styles. Each lesson is broken down into narrative hooks, reading, visual and auditory explanations, hands-on practice, memory aids, concept checks, and real-world connections.

## Current Status

- **Core Features Implemented:**
  - Modular lesson navigation with progress tracking (using localStorage)
  - Character-driven lesson introductions and guidance
  - Interactive learning objectives and completion banners
  - Section-based content delivery (story, read, see, hear, do, memory aids, concept check, real world)
  - Responsive UI built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui components
- **Editing & Deployment:**
  - Code can be edited via the Lovable web interface, locally in your IDE, or using GitHub/Codespaces
  - Easy deployment and preview through the Lovable platform

## Future Development Plans

- **Content Expansion:**
  - Add more lessons and modules covering additional math topics
  - Develop richer character backstories and interactions
- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - Implement user accounts and cloud-synced progress
  - Add gamification elements (badges, achievements, leaderboards)
  - Integrate more interactive problem types and adaptive feedback
  - Improve accessibility and support for diverse learners
- **Collaboration & Community:**
  - Enable teacher dashboards and classroom management tools
  - Allow user-generated content and lesson sharing
