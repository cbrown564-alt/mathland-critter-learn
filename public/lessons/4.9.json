  "readContent": "Optimization begins by finding critical points where ∇f = 0, meaning all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. The second derivative test uses the discriminant D = fₓₓfᵧᵧ - (fₓᵧ)² to classify critical points: D > 0 with fₓₓ > 0 gives local minima, D > 0 with fₓₓ < 0 gives local maxima, and D < 0 indicates saddle points. The Hessian matrix H contains all second partial derivatives and generalizes this analysis to higher dimensions. Machine learning uses gradient descent to minimize error functions, while economics applies optimization to utility maximization and cost minimization problems.",
  "readAnalogy": "Optimization is like a hedgehog finding the perfect spot in a mathematical landscape. First, I find all the flat spots (critical points where ∇f = 0), then I carefully examine the curvature around each spot to determine whether it's a hilltop (maximum), valley bottom (minimum), or mountain pass (saddle point).",

  "readDigDeeper": "For functions of n variables, the Hessian's eigenvalues determine critical point types: all positive eigenvalues mean local minimum, all negative mean local maximum, and mixed signs indicate saddle points. This connects linear algebra to optimization theory.",

    "options": [
      "Critical point (-1,0) is a saddle point since D = -4 < 0",
      "Critical point (1,0) is a local minimum since D = 4 > 0 and fₓₓ = 2 > 0",

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "∇f = ⟨2x+2, -2y⟩ = ⟨0,0⟩ gives critical point (-1,0). Second partials: fₓₓ = 2, fᵧᵧ = -2, fₓᵧ = 0. Discriminant D = (2)(-2) - 0² = -4 < 0, so (-1,0) is a saddle point."
