    "story": "Greta encounters a new challenge: sometimes she can't climb anywhere she wants! Imagine needing to find the highest point on a mountain, but you're restricted to following a specific trail. Constrained optimization adds boundaries and rules to our optimization problems, making them more realistic but more complex.",
    "characterMessage": "Real-world optimization rarely lets us go anywhere we want! Sometimes I need to find the lowest point while staying on a designated trail, or the highest peak while avoiding certain dangerous areas. Constrained optimization adds realistic limitations to our mathematical mountaineering!"

  "readContent": "Constrained optimization restricts solutions to feasible regions defined by constraints. Equality constraints g(x,y) = 0 force solutions onto curves or surfaces, while inequality constraints h(x,y) ≤ 0 define regions where solutions must lie. The method of Lagrange multipliers handles equality constraints by introducing new variables λ that measure the 'cost' of the constraint. The optimality conditions become ∇f = λ∇g along with the constraint g(x,y) = 0. Inequality constraints use Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which generalize Lagrange multipliers. Many real problems involve multiple constraints, creating complex feasible regions.",
  "readAnalogy": "Constrained optimization is like mountaineering with rules! Sometimes I must stay on marked trails (equality constraints), sometimes I must avoid dangerous areas (inequality constraints). The highest point I can reach might not be the mountain's true summit - it's the highest point I can reach while following the rules. Lagrange multipliers are like trail guides who help me find the best reachable spot!",

    "question": "To optimize f(x,y) = x² + y² subject to constraint g(x,y) = x + y - 2 = 0, what condition must be satisfied at the optimum?",
    "options": [
      "∇f = λ∇g, meaning ⟨2x,2y⟩ = λ⟨1,1⟩ for some λ",
      "∇f · ∇g = 0, meaning the gradients are perpendicular",
      "∇f + ∇g = 0, meaning the gradients cancel out",
      "f(x,y) = g(x,y) at the optimal point"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Lagrange multiplier condition: ∇f = λ∇g at the optimum. Here: ⟨2x,2y⟩ = λ⟨1,1⟩, giving 2x = λ and 2y = λ, so x = y. Combined with constraint x + y = 2, we get x = y = 1."
