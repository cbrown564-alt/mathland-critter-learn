  "readContent": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finds the main directions of variation in data by computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Each eigenvector (principal component) points in a direction of data variation, with the corresponding eigenvalue measuring the variance in that direction. The first principal component captures maximum variance, the second captures maximum remaining variance (orthogonal to the first), and so on. PCA enables dimensionality reduction by keeping only the top k components that explain most variance. This compresses high-dimensional data while preserving essential structure.",
  "readAnalogy": "PCA is like being a data detective with X-ray vision. You can see through the chaos of high-dimensional data to spot the few fundamental patterns that explain most of what's happening. It's reducing a complex mystery novel to its essential plot elements.",

  "conceptCheck": {
    "question": "In PCA, if the first principal component explains 60% of variance and the second explains 25%, how much information is preserved using just these two components?",
    "options": [
      "85% of the original data variance is captured",
      "35% of the original data variance is captured",
      "60% since the first component is most important",
      "Cannot determine without knowing the original dimensions"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The percentage of variance explained is additive for orthogonal principal components. First component: 60%, second component: 25%, total: 60% + 25% = 85% of original variance is preserved."
