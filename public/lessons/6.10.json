    "question": "In Part C, you model customer arrivals as Poisson(λ=5 per hour) and use Normal approximation. What justifies this approximation and what parameters should you use?",
    "options": [
      "Poisson(5) ≈ Normal(5, 5) since for large λ, Poisson approaches Normal with μ = σ² = λ",
      "Use Normal(5, √5) since Poisson variance equals the mean",
      "Cannot use Normal approximation since Poisson is discrete",
      "Both A and B describe the same approximation with different variance notation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "For large λ, Poisson(λ) ≈ Normal(λ, λ). Here: Poisson(5) ≈ Normal(5, 5). Since Normal uses standard deviation, this is Normal(μ=5, σ=√5). Both A and B are correct - A uses variance notation (σ²=5), B uses standard deviation notation (σ=√5)."
