  "readContent": "Symmetric matrices (A = Aᵀ) have special properties: all eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors from different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Even for repeated eigenvalues, symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvector bases. This enables orthogonal diagonalization A = QDQᵀ where Q has orthonormal eigenvectors as columns and QᵀQ = I. The spectral theorem guarantees this decomposition exists for any symmetric matrix. Orthogonal diagonalization represents the transformation as rotation to principal axes (Q), scaling along those axes (D), then rotation back (Qᵀ). This is fundamental to principal component analysis, quadratic forms, and optimization.",
