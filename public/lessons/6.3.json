    "story": "Pippa waves her magic wand and transforms chaotic outcomes into neat numerical values! Random variables are like magical translators that turn any random experiment - coin flips, dice rolls, or rabbit appearances - into numbers we can work with mathematically. Each random variable brings its own special distribution pattern!",
    "characterMessage": "Time for the ultimate magical transformation! Random variables turn any random outcome into numbers, and each one comes with its own beautiful distribution pattern. It's like having different magical formulae that tell me exactly how likely each number is to appear from my hat!"

  "readContent": "A random variable X is a function that assigns numerical values to experimental outcomes: X: Ω → ℝ. Discrete random variables take countable values (like dice rolls), described by probability mass functions P(X = x) that give exact probabilities for each value. Continuous random variables take uncountable values (like heights), described by probability density functions f(x) where probabilities are computed as integrals: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx. The cumulative distribution function F(x) = P(X ≤ x) works for both types, giving the probability that X doesn't exceed x. Different random phenomena produce characteristic distribution shapes.",
  "readAnalogy": "Random variables are like magical number-generating machines! Each experiment gets translated into numbers, and every machine has its own personality (distribution). Some machines prefer certain numbers (discrete distributions), while others spread smoothly across ranges (continuous distributions). The distribution tells me each machine's preferences!",

    "question": "For a discrete random variable X with PMF P(X=1)=0.3, P(X=2)=0.5, P(X=3)=0.2, what is P(X ≤ 2)?",
    "options": [
      "P(X ≤ 2) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) = 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8",
      "P(X ≤ 2) = P(X=2) = 0.5, since we want exactly 2",
      "P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - P(X=3) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8",
      "Both A and C are correct methods giving the same answer"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "P(X ≤ 2) includes X=1 and X=2, so P(X ≤ 2) = 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8. Alternatively, P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - P(X > 2) = 1 - P(X=3) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Both methods give 0.8."
