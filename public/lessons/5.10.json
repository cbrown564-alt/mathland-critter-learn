  "conceptCheck": {
    "question": "In Part D, your gradient descent algorithm converges to different points depending on the starting location. What does this reveal about the optimization landscape?",
    "options": [
      "The function has multiple local minima - it's non-convex with several basins of attraction",
      "The learning rate is wrong - properly tuned algorithms always find the same solution",
      "The function is convex but the algorithm implementation has bugs",
      "This behavior is impossible for properly implemented gradient descent"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Different convergence points from different starting locations indicates multiple local minima, confirming the function is non-convex. Each starting point falls into the basin of attraction of a different local minimum, which is typical behavior for complex optimization landscapes."
