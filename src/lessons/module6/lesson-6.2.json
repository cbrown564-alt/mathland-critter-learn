    "story": "Pippa discovers that some magic tricks depend on what happened before! Conditional probability is like updating the contents of her magic hat based on new information. Sometimes knowing one outcome completely changes the probabilities of others, while independent events mind their own magical business.",
    "characterMessage": "Time for some advanced magical mathematics! Conditional probability is like updating my predictions when I get new information. Sometimes events depend on each other like linked magic tricks, and sometimes they're completely independent like separate hat pulls. Let me show you how information changes everything!"

  "readContent": "Conditional probability P(A|B) measures the probability of A given that B has occurred, computed as P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B) when P(B) > 0. This represents updating our probability assessment based on new information. Events A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A), meaning knowledge of B doesn't change the probability of A. The multiplication rule gives P(A∩B) = P(A|B)P(B), allowing us to compute intersection probabilities. Tree diagrams visualize sequential conditional probabilities, while the law of total probability breaks down complex events into conditional pieces: P(A) = Σᵢ P(A|Bᵢ)P(Bᵢ).",
  "readAnalogy": "Conditional probability is like updating my magic hat based on what I've already pulled out! If I know a red card came out, that changes the probabilities for what's left inside. Independent events are like having two separate magic hats - what comes from one hat doesn't affect the other at all!",

Search engines use conditional probabilities to rank pages based on user click patterns. Credit scoring uses conditional default probabilities given financial history.",

    "mantra": "Given that this, then what? Conditional probability shows the plot! Independent means no effect at all - separate magic beyond conditioning's call!",
    "visual": "Picture Pippa's magic hat changing colors as she gets new information, with some compartments affecting others (dependence) while some remain completely separate (independence)."

    "question": "In a group, 60% like coffee, 40% like tea, and 20% like both. If someone likes coffee, what's the probability they also like tea?",
    "options": [
      "P(tea|coffee) = P(tea ∩ coffee)/P(coffee) = 0.20/0.60 = 1/3",
      "P(tea|coffee) = P(tea) = 0.40, since preferences are independent",
      "P(tea|coffee) = 0.20, the probability of liking both",
      "P(tea|coffee) = 0.80, since most coffee drinkers also like tea"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using conditional probability formula: P(tea|coffee) = P(tea ∩ coffee)/P(coffee) = 0.20/0.60 = 1/3. Knowing someone likes coffee changes the probability they like tea from 40% to 33.3%."
