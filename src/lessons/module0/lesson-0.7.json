    "question": "Find the distance between points (3, 4) and (6, 8). What formula do we use?",
    "options": [
      "5 units, using the distance formula √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]",
      "7 units, by adding the coordinate differences",
      "3 units, using only the x-coordinate difference",
      "12 units, by multiplying the coordinates"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using the distance formula: √[(6-3)² + (8-4)²] = √[3² + 4²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5 units. This formula comes from the Pythagorean theorem applied to coordinate geometry."
  },
  "readContent": "Felix needs precise measurements between his processing stations. The distance formula √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²] calculates exact distances using the Pythagorean theorem. The midpoint formula ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2) finds perfect center points. Slope (rise/run) measures steepness and direction of connections between stations.",
  "readAnalogy": "Coordinate geometry is like Felix's precision measurement toolkit. Distance formula measures cable lengths between stations, midpoint formula finds optimal connection points, and slope measures the efficiency of pathways.",
  "readKeyPoints": [
    "Distance formula: √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²] - Pythagorean theorem in coordinates",
    "Midpoint formula: ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2) - perfect center between two points",
    "Slope: (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁) - rise over run measures steepness"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "Parallel lines have identical slopes, while perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals (m₁ × m₂ = -1). The point-slope form y - y₁ = m(x - x₁) creates line equations from one point and the slope.",
