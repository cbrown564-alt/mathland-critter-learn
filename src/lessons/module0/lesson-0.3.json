    "story": "Sometimes Ollie needs to find the perfect spot where the water level meets his dam height. This is like solving equations - finding where two things are equal.",
    "characterMessage": "Finding the balance point is like solving equations! Just like I need to find where my dam height meets the water level perfectly, we solve equations to find where expressions are equal."

    "question": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13. What principle keeps the equation balanced?",
    "options": [
      "x = 4, using the balance principle",
      "x = 9, by adding 5 to both sides",
      "x = 6.5, by dividing everything by 2",
      "x = 8, by subtracting 5 from the left side only"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8, then divide by 2: x = 4. The balance principle means whatever we do to one side, we must do to the other to maintain equality."

  "readContent": "Finding where two things are equal is like finding the perfect water level for my dam. Linear equations (ax + b = 0) are like finding the right height for a straight beam. Quadratic equations (ax² + bx + c = 0) are like finding the optimal curve for water flow. I solve them systematically: isolation for linear equations, factoring or the quadratic formula for quadratics.",
  "readAnalogy": "Solving equations is like finding the perfect balance point where all forces are equal. Just like my dam needs to balance water pressure with structural strength, equations balance mathematical expressions to find exact solutions.",
