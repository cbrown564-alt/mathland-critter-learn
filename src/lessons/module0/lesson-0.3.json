      "x = 4, using the balance principle",
      "x = 9, by adding 5 to both sides",

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8, then divide by 2: x = 4. The balance principle means whatever we do to one side, we must do to the other to maintain equality."

I solve them systematically: isolation for linear equations, factoring or the quadratic formula for quadratics.",

    "Solving equations is like being a mathematical detective... you're systematically uncovering the value of unknown variables using logical steps and proven techniques.",
    "Linear equations are the straightforward cases. If I have 3x plus 7 equals 22, I solve it step by step... subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x equals 15, then divide both sides by 3 to find x equals 5. It's like following a clear construction sequence... each step moves me closer to the solution.",
    "The key principle is maintaining balance... whatever I do to one side of the equation, I must do to the other side. It's like keeping a bridge level... if I add weight to one side, I need to add equal weight to the other side.",
    "Quadratic equations require more sophisticated techniques. When I have x squared minus 5x plus 6 equals 0, I can factor it into x minus 2 times x minus 3 equals 0. Then I use the zero product property... if two factors multiply to zero, at least one must be zero. So x equals 2 or x equals 3.",
    "The quadratic formula is my universal tool for when factoring gets complicated. For any quadratic ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0, the solution is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a.",
    "In data science, you're constantly solving equations... finding optimal parameters for machine learning models, calculating statistical measures, or determining break-even points for business decisions. These equation-solving skills are your mathematical foundation tools."
