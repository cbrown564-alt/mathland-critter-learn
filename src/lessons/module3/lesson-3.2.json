    "question": "For matrix [[3,1],[0,2]], what is the characteristic equation and what are the eigenvalues?",
    "options": [
      "Characteristic equation: (3-λ)(2-λ) = 0, eigenvalues: λ = 3, 2",

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "For matrix [[3,1],[0,2]], det(A-λI) = det([[3-λ,1],[0,2-λ]]) = (3-λ)(2-λ) - 0×1 = (3-λ)(2-λ). Setting equal to zero gives eigenvalues λ = 3 and λ = 2."

    "Time for some mathematical detective work... Every matrix carries its eigenvalue secrets locked inside a special polynomial.",
    "Here's how we crack the code: we start with the fundamental eigenvector equation... A times v equals lambda times v. Rearrange this cleverly, and you get A minus lambda times I, all multiplied by v, equals zero.",
    "For this equation to have interesting solutions... non-trivial ones where v isn't just the zero vector... the matrix A minus lambda I must be singular. And singular matrices? They have determinant zero.",
    "So we set the determinant of A minus lambda I equal to zero. This creates what we call the characteristic equation... a polynomial where lambda is the unknown we're hunting for.",
    "For a 2 by 2 matrix, this becomes a quadratic equation. For 3 by 3, it's cubic. The roots of this polynomial? Those are our eigenvalues... all of them revealed at once.",
    "It's like breaking a combination lock where each eigenvalue is a different combination that unlocks the matrix's transformation secrets. Some matrices have real eigenvalues that stretch or shrink... others have complex eigenvalues that indicate rotational behavior with scaling."
