  "conceptCheck": {
    "question": "In Part A, you find that 3 principal components explain 85% of variance in a 10-dimensional dataset. What does this suggest about the data structure?",
    "options": [
      "The data has strong underlying structure - most variation lies in just 3 key directions",
      "The data is completely random with no discernible patterns",
      "All 10 dimensions are equally important for explaining the data",
      "The analysis failed because 85% is not sufficient retention"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "When 3 components out of 10 explain 85% of variance, it indicates the data has strong underlying structure. Most of the meaningful variation is captured by just 3 principal directions, suggesting the system has only 3 fundamental degrees of freedom."
