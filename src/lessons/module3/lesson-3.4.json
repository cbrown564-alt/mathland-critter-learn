When a matrix has enough linearly independent eigenvectors, I can perform the ultimate revelation: A = PDP⁻¹, where P contains eigenvectors and D displays eigenvalues along the diagonal. It's like having X-ray vision that sees through complex transformations to reveal the simple scaling structure underneath. Diagonalization transforms matrix powers into trivial calculations: A^n = PD^nP⁻¹.",
  "readAnalogy": "Diagonalization is like having a universal translator that converts any complex matrix language into a simple scaling dialect. The eigenvector matrix P provides the translation dictionary, while D shows the pure scaling effects without any rotational confusion.",
  "readKeyPoints": [
    "Diagonalization: A = PDP⁻¹ where P has eigenvectors as columns, D has eigenvalues on diagonal",

  "readDigDeeper": "Not all matrices are diagonalizable - those lacking sufficient eigenvectors are 'defective' and require Jordan normal form. However, symmetric matrices are always diagonalizable with orthogonal eigenvectors, making them mathematical aristocrats.",
  "readWhyMatters": "Google's PageRank algorithm uses diagonalization to efficiently compute authority scores for billions of web pages. Population geneticists use diagonalized matrices to predict how gene frequencies evolve over many generations. Financial analysts diagonalize correlation matrices to identify independent risk factors in complex portfolios.",
  "seeContent": "Watch the diagonalization construction process, see how matrix powers become trivial in diagonal form, and observe the geometric interpretation as coordinate system changes that reveal natural scaling directions.",

    "question": "If A has eigenvalues 3, 1 with eigenvectors [1,0] and [1,1], what is A³ using diagonalization?",
    "options": [
      "A³ = P[[27,0],[0,1]]P⁻¹ where P = [[1,1],[0,1]]",
      "A³ = P[[9,0],[0,3]]P⁻¹ where P = [[1,1],[0,1]]",
      "A³ = [[3,1],[0,1]]³ by direct multiplication",
      "Cannot compute A³ without knowing the original matrix A"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "A³ = PD³P⁻¹. With eigenvalues 3,1, we have D³ = [[3³,0],[0,1³]] = [[27,0],[0,1]]. The eigenvector matrix P = [[1,1],[0,1]], so A³ = P[[27,0],[0,1]]P⁻¹."
