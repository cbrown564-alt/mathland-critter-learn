    "story": "Sigmund reveals the mathematical heart of hypothesis testing: test statistics transform sample data into standardized measures of evidence, while p-values quantify exactly how rare the observed result would be if the null hypothesis were true. These elegant tools turn raw data into precise statements about statistical significance.",
    "characterMessage": "Now we reach the mathematical essence of hypothesis testing! Test statistics standardize our evidence into elegant mathematical form, while p-values answer the crucial question: 'How rare is what we observed?' These tools transform data into dignified statistical conclusions."

  "readContent": "Test statistics standardize sample evidence into a common scale for comparison with theoretical distributions. For population means: t = (X̄ - μ₀)/(s/√n), which measures how many standard errors the sample mean is from the hypothesized value. The p-value is the probability of observing data at least as extreme as what we observed, assuming H₀ is true. For two-tailed tests, p-value = 2 × P(T > |t|), while one-tailed tests use p-value = P(T > t). Decision rule: reject H₀ if p-value < α. Statistical significance (low p-value) doesn't guarantee practical importance - effect size matters. Common misconceptions: p-value is NOT the probability that H₀ is true, nor the probability of making an error.",
  "readAnalogy": "Test statistics are like standardized scoring systems that let us compare different types of evidence on the same elegant scale. P-values answer 'If the null hypothesis were true, how shocking would our observation be?' It's like asking: if swans truly can't fly over mountains, how surprising would it be to see what we just observed? The smaller the p-value, the more our evidence contradicts the null hypothesis.",
  "readKeyPoints": [
    "Test statistic standardizes evidence: t = (X̄ - μ₀)/(s/√n) for means",
    "P-value = P(data this extreme | H₀ true), NOT P(H₀ true | data)",
    "Decision rule: reject H₀ if p-value < α (significance level)"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "The p-value function p(x) = P(T ≥ t(x) | H₀) where t(x) is the test statistic computed from data x, provides a complete summary of evidence against H₀ for all possible observations. This function captures more information than just whether p < α.",
  "readWhyMatters": "Medical journals require p-values to establish treatment efficacy. Tech companies use p-values in A/B testing to validate product changes. Quality control uses p-values to detect manufacturing defects. Scientific research relies on p-values to establish credible findings, though with increasing awareness of their limitations.",

    "visual": "Picture Sigmund calculating how far his flight deviates from expected patterns (test statistic), then elegantly determining how rare such a deviation would be in the world of null hypothesis (p-value)."

    "question": "A test gives t = 2.1 with p-value = 0.03. What does this mean if α = 0.05?",
    "options": [
      "Reject H₀; if H₀ were true, we'd see data this extreme only 3% of the time",
      "Accept H₀; the sample mean is 2.1 standard errors above the null value",
      "There's a 3% chance the null hypothesis is true",
      "We're making a Type I error with 3% probability"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Since p-value = 0.03 < α = 0.05, we reject H₀. The p-value means that if H₀ were true, we would observe data this extreme or more extreme only 3% of the time. This is strong evidence against H₀."

Netflix uses p-values in A/B testing to determine if new features significantly improve user engagement.
