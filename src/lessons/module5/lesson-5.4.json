    "story": "Greta encounters two completely different types of mathematical terrain! Convex landscapes are like perfect bowl-shaped valleys with a single bottom point - easy to navigate with guaranteed success. Non-convex terrain is like a mountain range full of false peaks and hidden valleys - beautiful but treacherous for optimization!",
    "characterMessage": "Understanding terrain type is crucial for any serious climber! Convex functions are like perfect bowl-shaped valleys - any local minimum is THE global minimum, making optimization straightforward. Non-convex functions are like complex mountain ranges with false peaks and hidden valleys - much more challenging but often more interesting!"

  "readContent": "A function is convex if any line segment connecting two points on its graph lies above or on the surface. Mathematically: f(λx + (1-λ)y) ≤ λf(x) + (1-λ)f(y) for λ ∈ [0,1]. Geometrically, convex functions look like bowls or have upward curvature. The crucial property: any local minimum of a convex function is automatically the global minimum. For twice-differentiable functions, convexity requires a positive semidefinite Hessian everywhere. Non-convex functions can have multiple local minima, making optimization much more challenging as algorithms may get trapped in suboptimal solutions.",
  "readAnalogy": "Convex functions are like perfectly shaped valleys - if I roll a ball anywhere on the surface, it will always find the same bottom point. Non-convex functions are like complex mountain ranges where a ball might get stuck in various local valleys, never reaching the deepest point. This makes convex optimization like navigating with a GPS that guarantees finding the destination!",

    "question": "Function f(x,y) = x² + 3y² + 2xy has Hessian H = [[2,2],[2,6]]. Is this function convex?",
    "options": [
      "Yes, convex since H has eigenvalues 2+2√2 > 0 and 2-2√2 ≈ -0.83 < 0",
      "No, not convex since the mixed partial 2xy creates non-convex behavior",
      "Yes, convex since det(H) = 8 > 0 and tr(H) = 8 > 0",
      "Cannot determine without checking the discriminant D"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "For 2×2 matrices, positive definiteness (convexity) requires det(H) > 0 and tr(H) > 0. Here: det(H) = 2×6 - 2×2 = 8 > 0 and tr(H) = 2+6 = 8 > 0, so H is positive definite and f is convex. Actually, let me recalculate the eigenvalues: characteristic polynomial is (2-λ)(6-λ) - 4 = λ² - 8λ + 8, giving λ = 4 ± 2√2. Both eigenvalues 4+2√2 ≈ 6.83 and 4-2√2 ≈ 1.17 are positive, confirming convexity."
