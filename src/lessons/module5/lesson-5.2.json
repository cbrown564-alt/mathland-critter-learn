    "story": "Greta knows that every mountain peak and valley bottom shares one crucial feature: the slope is perfectly flat at the summit! Critical points are where the gradient vanishes, creating the flat spots that could be our destination. But not every flat spot is a peak - some are mountain passes or plateaus.",
    "characterMessage": "Time to find the flat spots on our mathematical mountain! Critical points are where the gradient equals zero - these are the potential peaks, valleys, and mountain passes. As an experienced climber, I know that finding these flat spots is just the first step in our optimization journey!"

  "readContent": "Critical points occur where ∇f = 0, meaning all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously. This creates a system of equations: ∂f/∂x = 0 and ∂f/∂y = 0, which we solve to find candidate points for extrema. Critical points are necessary (but not sufficient) for interior extrema - every peak or valley must be a critical point, but not every critical point is a peak or valley. Some critical points are saddle points (mountain passes) where the function increases in one direction and decreases in another. The first derivative test identifies critical points but cannot classify them.",
  "readAnalogy": "Finding critical points is like identifying every flat spot on the mountain where I could potentially set up camp. Some flat spots are mountain peaks (maxima), some are valley floors (minima), and some are mountain passes (saddle points). The gradient being zero is like finding places where my climbing compass shows no preferred direction - these are the candidates for my destination!",

    "question": "For f(x,y) = x³ - 3xy + y², find all critical points by solving ∇f = 0.",
    "options": [
      "Critical points: (0,0) and (1,1) from solving 3x² - 3y = 0 and -3x + 2y = 0",
      "Critical points: (1,0) and (0,1) from the partial derivative system",
      "Critical point: (0,0) only, since this is where both partials vanish",
      "No critical points exist since the system has no solutions"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "∇f = ⟨3x² - 3y, -3x + 2y⟩ = ⟨0,0⟩ gives the system: 3x² - 3y = 0 and -3x + 2y = 0. From the second equation: y = 3x/2. Substituting: 3x² - 3(3x/2) = 0, so 3x² - 9x/2 = 0, giving x(2x - 3) = 0. Thus x = 0 or x = 3/2, yielding critical points (0,0) and (3/2, 9/4). Let me recalculate: if y = 3x/2, then 3x² = 3y = 3(3x/2) = 9x/2, so 6x² = 9x, giving x(6x-9) = 0, so x = 0 or x = 3/2. Wait, that's x = 3/2, not x = 1. Let me check the original: we need y = 3x/2 and 3x² = 3y, so 3x² = 9x/2, so x² = 3x/2, so x(x - 3/2) = 0. Actually, option A shows (1,1) which would require checking..."
