  "readContent": "Model development synthesizes optimization theory with statistical practice. Linear regression minimizes squared errors using calculus-based normal equations or iterative gradient descent - exactly what you learned with Greta and Dr. Delta! Logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation requiring numerical optimization since no closed-form solution exists. Regularization prevents overfitting by adding penalty terms: Ridge regression (L2 penalty) shrinks coefficients smoothly, while Lasso regression (L1 penalty) performs feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. Cross-validation provides unbiased model performance estimates by training on subsets and testing on held-out data. Model comparison uses information criteria (AIC, BIC) that balance fit quality with model complexity, implementing automatic Occam's razor principles.",
  "readAnalogy": "Model development is like Greta climbing different mathematical mountains (loss functions) to find optimal viewpoints (parameter values). Dr. Delta's calculus provides the terrain analysis (gradients), while regularization acts like safety ropes preventing dangerous overfitting cliffs. Cross-validation is like testing your climbing route on multiple similar mountains to ensure your technique works generally, not just on one specific peak.",
