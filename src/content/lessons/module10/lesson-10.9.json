  "readContent": "Peer review ensures analytical quality through systematic colleague evaluation. Review criteria cover mathematical rigor (appropriate technique selection, assumption validation, uncertainty quantification), technical implementation (code quality, reproducibility, documentation), and business relevance (problem alignment, actionable insights, impact quantification). Effective feedback balances strengths recognition with improvement suggestions, focusing on specific, actionable recommendations rather than general criticism. Feedback integration requires critical evaluation: which suggestions improve accuracy, clarity, or impact? Professional review processes include methodology validation, result verification, and communication assessment. This collaborative quality assurance mirrors industry practice where analysis undergoes multiple review cycles before informing decisions.",
  "readAnalogy": "Peer review is like having fellow detectives examine your case before presenting to the court. Fresh eyes catch details you missed, alternative perspectives suggest better approaches, and collaborative scrutiny ensures your conclusions can withstand challenge. It's the difference between amateur investigation and professional-grade analysis.",

  "conceptCheck": {
    "question": "During peer review, a colleague suggests your confidence intervals are too narrow because you didn't account for model uncertainty. How should you respond?",
    "options": [
      "Investigate their concern by checking if bootstrap or Bayesian methods would give wider, more honest uncertainty estimates",
      "Defend your original approach since it followed standard statistical procedures",
      "Ignore the feedback since confidence intervals are mathematically correct",
      "Immediately change the analysis without understanding the underlying issue"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Good peer feedback deserves investigation. Model uncertainty beyond parameter estimation uncertainty is a valid concern that might require bootstrap methods, Bayesian approaches, or ensemble techniques for more honest uncertainty quantification."
