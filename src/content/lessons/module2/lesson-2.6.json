    "story": "Vera realizes that some of her forest paths are redundant. If she can reach any point using the river path and the perpendicular path, then a third diagonal path doesn't give her any new capabilities. This insight leads to one of the most important concepts in mathematics: linear independence - the art of eliminating redundancy while keeping all essential directions.",
    "characterMessage": "Independent vectors give you new directions to explore! It's like having the perfect toolkit - no redundant tools, but everything you need to reach anywhere you want to go. Can I get there without this vector? If yes, it's redundant!"

It's like having the perfect exploration toolkit - no redundant tools, but everything you need to reach anywhere. In 2D, you can have at most 2 independent vectors. In 3D, at most 3. More than that, and some become redundant passengers!",
  "readAnalogy": "Think of your vector toolkit: independent vectors are essential tools that each do something unique, while dependent vectors are duplicates taking up backpack space. Can I get there without this vector? If yes, it's redundant!",

    "Linear independence: no vector can be written as a combination of the others",
    "Test: c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + ... + cₙvₙ = 0 only when all c's equal zero",
    "Maximum independent vectors in n dimensions: n vectors"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "Linear dependence means at least one vector is redundant. Geometrically, dependent vectors point in directions already covered by other vectors. Testing independence often involves setting up and solving systems of equations.",
  "readWhyMatters": "In data analysis, independent features provide unique information while dependent features are redundant and can be eliminated. Machine learning algorithms perform better when input features are linearly independent, avoiding redundancy and improving prediction accuracy.",
  "seeContent": "Visualize how linearly dependent vectors collapse into lower-dimensional spaces, while independent vectors span full dimensional space. Watch the Independence Checker show when vectors provide genuinely new directions.",

  "conceptCheck": {
    "question": "Are vectors [1, 2], [3, 1], and [4, 3] linearly independent? Explain both algebraically and geometrically.",
    "options": [
      "No - [4,3] = [1,2] + [3,1], so they're linearly dependent",
      "Yes - all three vectors point in different directions",
      "No - you can only have 2 independent vectors in 2D space",
      "Yes - the determinant test confirms independence"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "In 2D space, at most 2 vectors can be linearly independent. With 3 vectors in 2D, at least one must be expressible as a linear combination of the others. Indeed, [4,3] = [1,2] + [3,1], confirming dependence."

  "realWorldConnection": "In data analysis, independent features provide unique information while dependent features are redundant and can be eliminated. Machine learning algorithms perform better when input features are linearly independent, avoiding the 'curse of dimensionality' and improving prediction accuracy.",
  "hearTranscript": [
    "Independent vectors give you new directions to explore! It's like having the perfect toolkit... no redundant tools, but everything you need to reach anywhere you want to go.",
    "Here's the key question I always ask: \"Can I get there without this vector?\" If the answer is yes, then that vector is redundant... it's a linear combination of the others and doesn't add any new directional capabilities.",
    "Linear independence is about eliminating redundancy while keeping all essential directions. In 2D space, you need exactly 2 independent vectors to reach anywhere. In 3D space, you need exactly 3. Any more, and you have redundancy.",
    "Think of it like exploring with a compass. If you have north and east directions, you can reach any point in the plane. Adding northeast doesn't give you new capabilities... it's just a combination of north and east you already have.",
    "In data science, linear independence reveals the intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. You might have 100 variables describing customers, but maybe only 5 independent patterns explain most of the variation. The rest is redundancy.",
    "Machine learning models depend on linear independence. Redundant features can cause numerical instability and overfitting. Independent features provide clean, non-overlapping information that models can learn from effectively.",
    "When vectors are linearly independent, they form a basis... a minimal set of directions that can reach everywhere in their space through linear combinations."
