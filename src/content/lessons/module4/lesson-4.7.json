  "readContent": "Diagonalization makes matrix powers trivial: if A = PDP⁻¹, then Aⁿ = PDⁿP⁻¹. Matrix exponentials e^{At} = Pe^{Dt}P⁻¹ where e^{Dt} is diagonal with entries e^{λᵢt}. For large n, the behavior of Aⁿ depends on eigenvalue magnitudes: |λ| > 1 grows, |λ| < 1 decays, |λ| = 1 is neutral. This determines stability of dynamical systems. Markov chains reach steady states determined by the eigenvalue λ = 1. Population models use matrix exponentials to predict growth patterns, where eigenvalues determine growth rates and eigenvectors show population distributions.",
  "readAnalogy": "Eigenvalues are like mathematical DNA that determines long-term behavior! Through diagonalization, matrix powers become trivial: A^n = PD^nP⁻¹, where eigenvalue magnitudes control destiny. If |λ| > 1, that direction grows exponentially; if |λ| < 1, it decays; if |λ| = 1, it remains stable. For matrix exponentials e^{At} = Pe^{Dt}P⁻¹, eigenvalues directly control the exponential growth rates of different directions in the system.",

    "question": "A population model has eigenvalues 1.2 and 0.8. What happens to populations over many generations?",
    "options": [
      "Population grows exponentially in the direction of the 1.2-eigenvalue eigenvector",

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Eigenvalue 1.2 > 1 causes exponential growth, while 0.8 < 1 causes decay. Over time, the 1.2-eigenvalue component dominates, so population grows exponentially in the direction of that eigenvector."
