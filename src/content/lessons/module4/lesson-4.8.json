  "readContent": "Complex eigenvalues λ = a ± bi appear in conjugate pairs for real matrices, indicating rotational or oscillatory behavior. The real part 'a' controls growth (a > 0) or decay (a < 0), while the imaginary part 'b' determines rotation frequency. The magnitude |λ| = √(a² + b²) shows overall growth/decay rate, and the argument determines oscillation period. Although eigenvectors are complex, real solutions can be constructed using the real and imaginary parts of complex eigenvectors. This creates spiraling trajectories in phase space, essential for understanding vibrations, electrical circuits, and population cycles.",

  "hearTranscript": [
    "When eigenvalues become complex numbers, matrices reveal their most dynamic secrets... rotation combined with scaling, creating spiral behaviors that govern everything from population cycles to engineering stability.",
    "Complex eigenvalues always come in conjugate pairs for real matrices... if a plus bi is an eigenvalue, then a minus bi is also an eigenvalue. The real part determines whether systems grow or decay, while the imaginary part controls oscillation frequency.",
    "In population biology, predator-prey systems often have complex eigenvalues that create spiral trajectories... populations cycle through boom and bust phases with mathematical precision.",
    "Engineering stability analysis relies on eigenvalue location. If all eigenvalues have negative real parts, the system is stable... small perturbations decay back to equilibrium. But if any eigenvalue has positive real part, the system becomes unstable... small disturbances grow exponentially.",
    "When civil engineers design buildings to withstand earthquakes, they analyze the eigenvalues of structural vibration modes. Complex eigenvalues with positive real parts indicate dangerous resonances that could amplify seismic motion catastrophically.",
    "Economic models use eigenvalue analysis to study market stability. Complex eigenvalues often indicate boom-bust cycles, while eigenvalues near the unit circle suggest systems on the edge of stability.",
    "Even seemingly stable systems can harbor complex eigenvalue secrets that predict surprising dynamic behaviors."
