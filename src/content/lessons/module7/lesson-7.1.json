As a rabbit who specializes in the unpredictable, she knows that probability is the mathematics of uncertainty - turning the chaos of random events into precise, beautiful patterns that we can understand and predict.",
    "characterMessage": "Welcome to the wonderful world of uncertainty! I'm Pippa, and I make the unpredictable predictable through the magic of probability! Every coin flip, every die roll, every random event follows beautiful mathematical patterns. Let me show you how to find order in chaos!"

  "readContent": "Probability quantifies uncertainty by assigning numbers between 0 and 1 to events. The sample space Ω contains all possible outcomes of an experiment, while events are subsets of this space. The probability function P satisfies three axioms: P(A) ≥ 0 for any event A, P(Ω) = 1, and P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) when A and B are disjoint. For finite sample spaces with equally likely outcomes, P(A) = |A|/|Ω| (favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes). Key rules include: P(Aᶜ) = 1 - P(A) for complements, and P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) for general unions.",
  "readAnalogy": "Think of probability like my magic hat filled with all possible outcomes! The sample space is everything that could possibly be pulled from the hat, while events are specific collections of outcomes I'm interested in.

    "question": "Rolling two dice, what's the probability of getting a sum of 7, given that all 36 outcomes are equally likely?",
    "options": [
      "P(sum = 7) = 6/36 = 1/6, since there are 6 ways: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)",
      "P(sum = 7) = 1/11, since sums range from 2 to 12",
      "P(sum = 7) = 7/36, since we want sum 7 out of 36 outcomes",
      "P(sum = 7) = 2/12, since 7 is in the middle of possible sums"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Sample space has 36 equally likely outcomes. Event 'sum = 7' contains 6 outcomes: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Therefore P(sum = 7) = 6/36 = 1/6."

    "Hello there, fellow explorers of uncertainty! I'm Probability Pippa, and I make the unpredictable predictable through the magic of probability!",
    "Every magical trick starts with knowing all the possible outcomes... and that's exactly what sample space is in probability. It's like having a magical hat that contains every possible result of any random experiment.",
    "When I flip a coin, my sample space is simple: heads or tails. When I roll a six-sided die, the sample space contains six equally magical outcomes: one, two, three, four, five, and six. But when I pull cards from a deck or predict next week's weather, the sample spaces become wonderfully complex.",
    "Events are the magical subsets we actually care about. Instead of listing every possible outcome, events let us group outcomes that matter for our predictions. \"Rolling an even number\" is an event containing three outcomes: two, four, and six.",
    "Weather forecasting uses sample spaces constantly. Meteorologists consider all possible temperature, humidity, and wind combinations, then calculate probabilities for events like \"rain tomorrow\" or \"temperature above 75 degrees.\"",
    "Medical diagnosis works the same way. Doctors consider sample spaces of all possible conditions, then calculate probabilities for events like \"patient has condition X given these symptoms.\"",
    "The magic happens when we assign probabilities to events... transforming uncertainty into actionable mathematical insights."
