    "story": "Pippa discovers that some magic tricks depend on what happened before! Conditional probability is like updating the contents of her magic hat based on new information. Sometimes knowing one outcome completely changes the probabilities of others, while independent events mind their own magical business.",
    "characterMessage": "Time for some advanced magical mathematics! Conditional probability is like updating my predictions when I get new information. Sometimes events depend on each other like linked magic tricks, and sometimes they're completely independent like separate hat pulls. Let me show you how information changes everything!"

  "readContent": "Conditional probability P(A|B) measures the probability of A given that B has occurred, computed as P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B) when P(B) > 0. This represents updating our probability assessment based on new information. Events A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A), meaning knowledge of B doesn't change the probability of A. The multiplication rule gives P(A∩B) = P(A|B)P(B), allowing us to compute intersection probabilities. Tree diagrams visualize sequential conditional probabilities, while the law of total probability breaks down complex events into conditional pieces: P(A) = Σᵢ P(A|Bᵢ)P(Bᵢ).",
  "readAnalogy": "Conditional probability is like updating my magic hat based on what I've already pulled out! If I know a red card came out, that changes the probabilities for what's left inside. Independent events are like having two separate magic hats - what comes from one hat doesn't affect the other at all!",

  "readWhyMatters": "Spam filters use conditional probability to classify emails based on word patterns. Medical tests report conditional probabilities of diseases given positive results. Search engines use conditional probabilities to rank pages based on user click patterns. Credit scoring uses conditional default probabilities given financial history.",

    "question": "In a group, 60% like coffee, 40% like tea, and 20% like both. If someone likes coffee, what's the probability they also like tea?",
    "options": [
      "P(tea|coffee) = P(tea ∩ coffee)/P(coffee) = 0.20/0.60 = 1/3",
      "P(tea|coffee) = P(tea) = 0.40, since preferences are independent",
      "P(tea|coffee) = 0.20, the probability of liking both",
      "P(tea|coffee) = 0.80, since most coffee drinkers also like tea"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using conditional probability formula: P(tea|coffee) = P(tea ∩ coffee)/P(coffee) = 0.20/0.60 = 1/3. Knowing someone likes coffee changes the probability they like tea from 40% to 33.3%."

  "realWorldConnection": "Google's search algorithm uses conditional probabilities to rank pages based on user click patterns given specific queries. Medical diagnostic systems calculate disease probabilities conditional on observed symptoms. Netflix recommends movies using conditional probabilities based on viewing history and user similarities.",
  "hearTranscript": [
    "Conditional probability is like having magical powers that get stronger every time you learn something new... each piece of information updates your predictions!",
    "When I perform card tricks, conditional probability is everything. If I know the first card drawn was red, that changes the probability that the next card will be red too. There are fewer red cards left in the deck, so the probabilities shift accordingly.",
    "Independence is a special kind of magic where events don't influence each other. Coin flips are independent... knowing the first flip came up heads doesn't change the probability of heads on the second flip. The coin has no memory of previous results.",
    "But most real-world events aren't independent. If you know someone exercises regularly, that changes the probability they have low blood pressure. If you know it's cloudy, that changes the probability of rain. These conditional relationships are what make prediction possible.",
    "Medical diagnosis relies heavily on conditional probability. The probability of having a disease changes dramatically based on test results, symptoms, and risk factors. Doctors constantly update disease probabilities as new information becomes available.",
    "Financial markets use conditional probability for risk assessment. The probability of stock price movements depends on economic indicators, company news, and market sentiment. Each new piece of information updates the probability calculations.",
    "Understanding conditional probability gives you the mathematical tools to think clearly about how new information should change your beliefs."
