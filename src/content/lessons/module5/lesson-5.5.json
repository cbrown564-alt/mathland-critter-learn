    "story": "Dr. Delta sharpens his computational skills, applying all the familiar differentiation rules to partial derivatives. The key insight: when computing ∂f/∂x, treat all other variables as constants and proceed with standard calculus techniques. It's like having a Swiss Army knife of differentiation rules!",
    "characterMessage": "Now for the computational precision I love! Computing partial derivatives is beautifully systematic - all our familiar differentiation rules work perfectly, we just need to remember which variable we're focusing on and treat the others as constants. Let's build mastery through practice!"

  "coreConcepts": [
    "Product rule: ∂/∂x[uv] = u(∂v/∂x) + v(∂u/∂x)",
    "Quotient rule: ∂/∂x[u/v] = [v(∂u/∂x) - u(∂v/∂x)]/v²",
    "Chain rule for composite functions",
    "Higher-order partials: ∂²f/∂x², ∂²f/∂x∂y",
    "Implicit partial differentiation"
  ],
  "readContent": "Computing partial derivatives uses all familiar single-variable rules with one crucial modification: treat other variables as constants. Product rule becomes ∂/∂x[uv] = u(∂v/∂x) + v(∂u/∂x) where u and v may depend on multiple variables. Chain rule handles compositions like ∂/∂x[f(g(x,y))] = f'(g(x,y))·(∂g/∂x). Higher-order partials involve repeated differentiation: ∂²f/∂x² differentiates twice with respect to x, while ∂²f/∂x∂y differentiates first with respect to y, then x. Mixed partials are often equal when continuous.",
  "readAnalogy": "Computing partial derivatives is like being a hedgehog mechanic with a perfectly organized toolbox. Each differentiation rule is a specialized tool that works exactly the same way as in single-variable calculus, but now I carefully focus on one variable while treating others as fixed constants.",
  "readKeyPoints": [
    "All standard differentiation rules apply to partial derivatives",
    "Key principle: treat other variables as constants during differentiation",
    "Mixed partials ∂²f/∂x∂y often equal ∂²f/∂y∂x when continuous"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "Clairaut's theorem guarantees equality of mixed partials when they're continuous. This symmetry property is fundamental to many applications, including the exactness conditions for differential equations and conservative vector fields.",
  "readWhyMatters": "Computational fluency with partial derivatives is essential for optimization, where we need to find critical points by setting all partial derivatives to zero. Engineers use complex partial derivative calculations for stress analysis, economists for utility maximization, and physicists for field theory computations.",
  "seeContent": "Watch step-by-step partial derivative computations using different rules, see how higher-order partials create more complex expressions, and observe the computational patterns that emerge from systematic application of differentiation rules.",

    "explanation": "Using product rule: ∂f/∂x = [∂/∂x(e^(xy))] · sin(x²y) + e^(xy) · [∂/∂x(sin(x²y))] = ye^(xy) sin(x²y) + e^(xy) · cos(x²y) · 2xy = ye^(xy) sin(x²y) + 2xye^(xy) cos(x²y)."

    "Directional derivatives are like having a mathematical speedometer that measures how fast things change along any path you choose... not just the steepest ones.",
    "While the gradient tells you the direction of maximum change, directional derivatives let you ask more specific questions: if I walk northeast from this point, how fast will the temperature increase? If I move diagonally across this economic landscape, how quickly will costs change?",
    "This flexibility is crucial for practical optimization. Sometimes you can't move in the steepest direction because of constraints. A hiker might want to climb steeply but needs to follow an existing trail. A company might want to maximize profit but faces regulatory restrictions on certain variables.",
    "Financial portfolio management uses directional derivatives to understand risk along specific investment strategies. Instead of asking how returns change with respect to individual stocks, analysts calculate how portfolio performance changes along planned allocation directions.",
    "Autonomous vehicles use directional derivatives for path planning. Self-driving cars calculate how safety metrics change along proposed trajectories, helping them choose routes that minimize collision risk while maintaining reasonable speed.",
    "The mathematical beauty is that directional derivatives equal the dot product of the gradient with the unit direction vector. This elegant formula connects vector operations with calculus, showing how linear algebra and calculus work together seamlessly.",
    "Understanding directional derivatives gives you precise control over how you measure and navigate change in complex multivariable environments."
