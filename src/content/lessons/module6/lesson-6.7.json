    "story": "Greta discovers that sometimes the best way down a mountain isn't just following the immediate slope! Momentum methods remember previous directions and build up speed, like a skier who gains momentum down a slope. This helps push through small bumps and reach the bottom faster than just following the local gradient.",
    "characterMessage": "Time for advanced mountaineering techniques! Pure gradient descent is like walking everywhere, but momentum methods are like skiing - I build up speed from previous steps and can coast through small uphill sections. This momentum helps me escape shallow valleys and reach the true bottom faster!"

  "readContent": "Momentum methods accumulate gradient information over time using exponential moving averages. The momentum update becomes: vₖ₊₁ = βvₖ + α∇f(xₖ) and xₖ₊₁ = xₖ - vₖ₊₁, where v represents velocity and β ∈ [0,1) controls momentum strength. This helps in several ways: accelerates convergence in consistent directions, dampens oscillations in ravine-like functions, and helps escape shallow local minima. Nesterov momentum improves this by evaluating gradients at predicted future positions. Modern optimizers like Adam combine momentum with adaptive learning rates, automatically adjusting both direction and step size.",
  "readAnalogy": "Momentum is like skiing down a mountain instead of just walking! When I'm skiing, I build up speed in good directions and can coast through small uphill bumps that would stop a walker. The momentum parameter β controls how much I remember my previous speed - high β means I'm like a heavy skier who maintains momentum well, low β means I'm like a light skier who changes direction quickly.",

    "Helps accelerate in consistent directions and dampen oscillations",
    "Parameter β controls how much previous direction information to retain"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "The momentum parameter β = 0.9 means that 90% of the previous velocity is retained, creating an exponential moving average with effective memory of about 1/(1-β) = 10 previous gradients. This mathematical insight connects momentum to signal processing and time series analysis.",
