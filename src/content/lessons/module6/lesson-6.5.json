    "story": "Pippa unveils her collection of continuous magic! Unlike discrete distributions that prefer specific numbers, continuous distributions flow smoothly across ranges like magical rivers. The Uniform distribution spreads evenly, Exponential distribution models waiting times, and the magnificent Normal distribution creates the famous bell curve that appears everywhere in nature!",
    "characterMessage": "Now for the smooth, flowing magic of continuous distributions! These don't pick specific numbers - they flow like magical rivers across ranges of possibilities. Uniform spreads evenly, Exponential handles waiting times, and Normal creates that beautiful bell curve we see everywhere in nature!"

  "coreConcepts": [
    "Uniform(a,b): constant density f(x) = 1/(b-a) on [a,b]",
    "Exponential(λ): waiting times, f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0",
    "Normal(μ,σ²): bell curve, f(x) = (1/σ√2π)e^(-(x-μ)²/2σ²)",
    "Standard Normal Z ~ N(0,1) and Z-scores",
    "Integration for probability calculations"
  ],
  "readContent": "Uniform(a,b) has constant density f(x) = 1/(b-a) on interval [a,b], modeling scenarios where all values in a range are equally likely. Exponential(λ) models waiting times between events with f(x) = λe^(-λx), exhibiting memoryless property. Normal(μ,σ²) creates the famous bell curve with f(x) = (1/σ√2π)e^(-(x-μ)²/2σ²), where μ controls center and σ controls spread. The Standard Normal Z ~ N(0,1) allows probability calculations via standardization: Z = (X-μ)/σ. Probabilities require integration: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx, often done using tables or computational tools.",
  "readAnalogy": "Continuous distributions are like magical flowing rivers! Uniform distribution flows at constant speed everywhere in its range. Exponential starts as a rushing torrent but slows down exponentially - perfect for modeling how long until the next magical event. Normal distribution flows in that beautiful bell shape we see everywhere in nature - from heights to test scores!",

  "readDigDeeper": "The Central Limit Theorem explains why Normal distributions appear everywhere: sums of many independent random variables tend toward Normal distributions regardless of the original distributions, making the bell curve nature's favorite pattern.",
  "readWhyMatters": "Financial models use Normal distributions for stock price changes and portfolio returns. Manufacturing uses Normal distributions to model measurement errors and quality variations. Telecommunications uses Exponential distributions for modeling call durations and service times. Psychology uses Normal distributions for modeling test scores and cognitive abilities.",

    "question": "For Exponential(λ=2) modeling waiting time in hours, what's P(wait ≤ 1 hour) = P(X ≤ 1)?",
    "options": [
      "P(X ≤ 1) = 1 - e^(-2×1) = 1 - e^(-2) ≈ 0.865",
      "P(X ≤ 1) = 2e^(-2×1) = 2e^(-2) ≈ 0.271",
      "P(X ≤ 1) = ∫₀¹ 2e^(-2x)dx = [-e^(-2x)]₀¹ = 1 - e^(-2) ≈ 0.865",
      "Both A and C are correct using different methods"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "For Exponential(λ), P(X ≤ x) = 1 - e^(-λx). Method A uses this formula directly. Method C integrates the PDF: ∫₀¹ 2e^(-2x)dx = [-e^(-2x)]₀¹ = (1 - e^(-2)) - (1 - 1) = 1 - e^(-2) ≈ 0.865. Both give the same answer."

    "Expectation and variance are like magical crystal balls that summarize entire probability distributions with just two numbers... central tendency and spread.",
    "Expected value isn't what you expect to happen... it's the long-run average if you could repeat the same uncertain situation thousands of times. When I flip a fair coin for dollar bets, my expected value is zero. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, but over many flips, they balance out.",
    "Variance measures how spread out the outcomes are around the expectation. Low variance means outcomes cluster tightly around the average. High variance means outcomes are scattered widely, creating more uncertainty.",
    "Casinos understand expectation perfectly. Every game has negative expected value for players... the house edge ensures long-run profitability. Individual players might win big, but the casino's expected profit is mathematically guaranteed.",
    "Investment portfolios balance expected returns with variance. High-return investments often have high variance... greater potential gains come with greater uncertainty. Portfolio theory uses mathematical optimization to find the best risk-return combinations.",
    "Quality control uses expectation and variance to monitor manufacturing processes. Product specifications have target values (expectation) and tolerance ranges (variance). Statistical process control detects when either measure moves outside acceptable bounds.",
    "Understanding expectation and variance gives you mathematical tools to summarize and compare any uncertain situation with precision."
