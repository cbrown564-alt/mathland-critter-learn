    "story": "Ollie's dam needs to be at least 3 feet high to work properly, but no more than 6 feet to avoid flooding. This is like mathematical inequalities - values within a range.",
    "characterMessage": "The water level must be between these marks! Just like my dam has safe operating ranges, inequalities help us define acceptable ranges of values in mathematics and data science."

    "question": "Solve the inequality: |x - 3| < 5. What does this represent?",
    "options": [
      "-2 < x < 8, values within 5 units of 3",
      "x < -2 or x > 8, values outside the range",
      "x = 3 ± 5, two specific solutions",
      "-5 < x < 5, symmetric around zero"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The absolute value inequality |x - 3| < 5 means the distance from x to 3 is less than 5, giving us -5 < x - 3 < 5, which simplifies to -2 < x < 8."
  },
  "readContent": "My dam needs to operate within safe ranges - at least 3 feet high to function, but no more than 6 feet to prevent flooding. Inequalities express these range relationships: x ≥ 3 and x ≤ 6, or combined as 3 ≤ x ≤ 6. Absolute value |x-a| measures distance from point a, so |x-3| < 2 means within 2 units of position 3.",
  "readAnalogy": "Inequalities are like safety margins for my dam operations. Instead of exact measurements, I need acceptable ranges that keep everything functioning safely within operational limits.",
  "readKeyPoints": [
    "Inequality signs: < (less than), ≤ (less than or equal), > (greater than), ≥ (greater than or equal)",
    "Absolute value |x| measures distance from zero, regardless of direction",
    "Compound inequalities use 'and' (intersection) or 'or' (union) to combine conditions"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "When multiplying or dividing inequalities by negative numbers, the inequality sign flips. Absolute value inequalities split into two cases: |x| < a becomes -a < x < a, while |x| > a becomes x < -a or x > a.",
  "readWhyMatters": "Inequalities define confidence intervals in statistics, acceptable error ranges in engineering, constraint optimization in business, and classification thresholds in machine learning. They help us understand when data values are within acceptable operational limits.",
  "seeContent": "Visualize inequality solutions on interactive number lines, and see how absolute value creates distance relationships on the coordinate plane.",
  "hearContent": "Listen as I explain how setting boundaries and ranges for my dam is just like defining inequality constraints - we need safe operating zones for everything to work properly!",

    "Inequalities and absolute values help us understand ranges, constraints, and real-world limitations... essential tools for data science applications where exact answers are less important than understanding boundaries.",
    "Linear inequalities work like equations, with one crucial difference... when you multiply or divide by a negative number, you flip the inequality sign. It's like changing the direction of a construction project... if I'm building downward instead of upward, all my directional references reverse.",
    "If I have negative 2x plus 6 is greater than 10, I subtract 6 from both sides to get negative 2x greater than 4. Then I divide by negative 2, flipping the inequality to get x less than negative 2.",
    "Compound inequalities describe ranges. When I write negative 3 less than x less than or equal to 5, I'm describing all values between negative 3 and 5, including 5 but not negative 3. It's like specifying the safe operating range for construction equipment.",
    "Absolute values measure distance from zero, regardless of direction. The absolute value of negative 7 equals 7, just like the absolute value of positive 7 equals 7. When solving absolute value equations like the absolute value of x minus 3 equals 5, I consider both cases... x minus 3 equals 5 OR x minus 3 equals negative 5, giving me x equals 8 or x equals negative 2.",
    "In manufacturing, tolerances use inequality thinking... a part might need to be 10 millimeters plus or minus 0.1 millimeters. In data science, confidence intervals and error bounds use the same mathematical reasoning.",
    "These concepts help you think about uncertainty, constraints, and acceptable ranges... fundamental skills for real-world problem solving."
