    "story": "Max needs to measure the 'power' of his transformation matrices. How much do they stretch or shrink areas? Do they flip orientations? The determinant is Max's mathematical measuring tool that captures the essential transformation strength and behavior of any matrix in a single number.",
    "characterMessage": "Every transformation has a signature number that tells its complete story! The determinant measures transformation power - how much does it stretch or shrink areas (2D) or volumes (3D)? For 2×2 matrices: det(A) = ad - bc. The absolute value |det(A)| shows the scaling factor, while the sign indicates orientation: positive preserves orientation, negative flips it like a mirror. If det(A) = 0, the transformation collapses everything to a lower dimension - it's singular and non-invertible."

  "readContent": "The determinant of a matrix measures how much the matrix transformation scales areas (2D) or volumes (3D). For 2×2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]], det(A) = ad - bc. For 3×3 matrices, use cofactor expansion along any row or column. Geometrically, |det(A)| gives the scaling factor for areas/volumes, while the sign indicates orientation: positive preserves orientation, negative reverses it. If det(A) = 0, the matrix collapses space to lower dimension and is non-invertible (singular). If det(A) ≠ 0, the matrix is invertible with det(A⁻¹) = 1/det(A).",

    "question": "A transformation matrix has determinant -3. What does this tell you about the transformation?",
    "options": [
      "Areas are scaled by factor 3 and orientation is reversed (mirror flip)",
      "Areas are scaled by factor -3 (impossible negative area)",
      "The transformation shrinks everything by 1/3",
      "The matrix is not invertible"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Determinant -3 means: |det| = 3 so areas scale by factor 3 (magnification), and the negative sign means orientation reverses (like a mirror flip). The transformation is invertible since det ≠ 0."

  "hearTranscript": [
    "Every transformation has a signature number that tells its complete story... the determinant.",
    "For a 2 by 2 matrix, it's beautifully simple: a times d minus b times c. That single number captures the transformation's essential personality.",
    "The absolute value tells you the scaling factor... how much areas grow or shrink. A determinant of 3 means areas triple in size. A determinant of one-half means areas shrink by half.",
    "The sign reveals even more: positive means the transformation preserves orientation, negative means it flips everything like a mirror. Zero determinant? That's the ultimate collapse... the transformation squashes everything into a lower dimension.",
    "When your phone's camera automatically adjusts focus, when economists model how sector changes ripple through entire economies, when engineers calculate structural stability... they're all reading the determinant to understand transformation power."
