    "story": "Now that Ollie has his dam operating within safe ranges, he needs to understand how his construction process transforms materials into finished structures. Functions are like his reliable construction blueprints - same materials always produce the same result when following the same plan.",
    "characterMessage": "Now that we've got our ranges sorted out, let's talk about how I actually build things! Functions are like my construction blueprints - I take materials, follow my plans step by step, and get reliable results every time. Same input materials, same finished structure!"

  "learningObjectives": [
    "Understand function notation f(x) and its meaning",
    "Identify domain and range of functions",
    "Evaluate functions at specific values",
    "Understand function composition basics",
    "Distinguish between one-to-one and many-to-one functions"
  ],
  "coreConcepts": [
    "Function notation f(x)",
    "Domain and range",
    "Evaluating functions",
    "Function composition",

    "mantra": "Materials → Blueprint → Structure - that's how I build everything step by step!",
    "visual": "Ollie at his construction site with materials going in, following blueprint plans, and finished dam structures coming out"
  },
  "realWorldConnection": "In engineering and data science, functions help us model relationships: how material quality affects dam strength, how rainfall affects reservoir levels, or how construction variables predict project success. Functions are the foundation of engineering calculations and machine learning algorithms.",

    "question": "If f(x) = 2x + 3, what is f(4) and what does this notation mean?",
    "options": [
      "f(4) = 11, meaning input 4 materials gives output 11 finished pieces",
      "f(4) = 7, meaning multiply 4 by 2 then subtract 3",
      "f(4) = 2x + 7, meaning add 4 to the function",
      "f(4) = 8, meaning only multiply by 2"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "f(4) means substitute 4 for x in the function: f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11. Function notation tells us what output we get when we input a specific value - like following a construction plan with specific materials."

  "readContent": "Ollie the Engineer follows reliable construction plans: materials go in, transformation happens according to blueprints, finished structures come out. Function notation f(x) means 'apply construction plan f to materials x.' The domain is all valid materials (what Ollie can work with), and the range is all possible structures (what Ollie can build). Every input gets exactly one output - that's what makes Ollie's construction reliable!",
  "readAnalogy": "Think of functions as reliable construction systems like Ollie's - you put raw materials in one end, the system follows its engineering plans to transform them, and finished structures come out the other end. Same materials always produce the same result when following the same blueprint.",
  "readKeyPoints": [
    "Function notation f(x) reads as 'f of x' - apply construction plan f to materials x",
    "Domain: all possible input materials that work with the plan",
    "Range: all possible structures the plan can produce"
  ],
  "readDigDeeper": "Function composition f(g(x)) means apply construction plan g first, then plan f to that result. Inverse functions f⁻¹(x) undo what f(x) does - like deconstructing a structure back to materials. Piecewise functions have different construction rules for different material types.",
  "readWhyMatters": "In engineering and data science, functions model relationships: how material quality affects structural strength, how environmental conditions affect construction outcomes, or how design parameters predict performance. Functions are the mathematical foundation of engineering calculations and machine learning algorithms.",
  "seeContent": "Watch Ollie demonstrate construction processes with animated materials and outputs, showing how different function types transform inputs into predictable engineering results.",
  "hearContent": "Listen as I explain how I follow construction plans to transform materials - just like how engineering processes and data transformation pipelines work in real projects!",
  "hearAudioUrl": "/audio/0.5.mp3",
  "doContent": "Use the construction simulator to see how materials become structures, practice function evaluation exercises with engineering examples, and build your own construction process chains.",
  "hearTranscript": [
    "Hey there! I'm Ollie, and just like I build dams step by step, functions are mathematical processing systems that transform inputs into outputs following precise construction rules.",
    "Think of functions like my dam-building process... you put raw materials in one end, I follow my engineering plans to transform them, and finished structures come out the other end. Same materials always produce the same result when I follow the same blueprint... that's what makes me reliable!",
    "Function notation f(x) is like my project label system... it means \"apply construction plan f to materials x.\" When you see f(x) equals 2x plus 3, that's my instruction manual. If you bring me 4 logs, I substitute them everywhere I see x: f(4) equals 2 times 4 plus 3, which equals 11 finished pieces. Input 4 logs, output 11 pieces... construction complete!",
    "My domain is all the materials I can work with... like the types of wood and stone my tools can handle. My range is all possible structures I can build... the complete catalog of projects I'm capable of completing.",
    "The key engineering principle: every input gets exactly one output. I can't build two different dams from the same materials following the same plan... that would violate my construction protocols and cause structural problems.",
    "In data science, functions model relationships everywhere. How does material quality affect dam strength? How does rainfall affect reservoir levels? These are all function relationships that engineers and data scientists use to build predictive models and reliable systems."
